<!-- # Prajwal Shetty's Portfolio -->

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Game and Application Developer with 5 years of professional experience in Unity 3D, Blender, and Unreal Engine. Here, you can explore some of my projects.

[Resume](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwfkishzf/image/upload/v1682509226/Prajwal_Shetty_April-23_okwl4k.pdf){:target="_blank"} \| [Github](https://github.com/prajwalshettydev){:target="_blank"} \| [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shettyprajwal/){:target="_blank"}

### Animalia Card Game - Kevuru Games
Animalia is an independent f2p online NFT trading card game featuring crypto-inspired meme creatures.
I worked on both client and server sides, with a .NET backend in the server and unity in the client side. The game had multiple gameplay elements like special spells, abilities, gemstones etc, it also had per card ability animations and special effects.

### MOBA in Unity's HDRP - Kevuru Games
It's a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Game built for PCs with unity hdrp, the game is under NDA so I can only show the basic dev reel and early footage.
I worked on setting up the game connection, player combat, mirror networking and other game mechanics.

### Procedural Runtime Terrain and Road system with UE5 and C++

A high performance runtime terrain mesh generation system as a hobby project in Unreal Engine 5.1 C++. Island also has road network and spline systems, and may be will add a traffic system with point of interests in the future.

### Spacejoy's Design apps
Desktop and mobile apps built for loading and interacting with 50 thousand+ 3D models all in realtime, 

Unity as a library mobile app (iOS/Android) with React-native and Unity deep integrated:

### Blender Add-on

#### Spacejoy Client plugin:
Fetches 100+ `".blend"` or `"gltf"` files of independent furniture 3D models from the cloud and merges and places them together to make one full design. Sets up lighting camera, render settings and other things, all in one click for the 3D artist.
Also had Auth, 3D object processing tools like quality check etc.

#### Backend:
- Setup in the cloud as docker instance, this plugin was built to automate cycles render output for designs, or batch generating furniture thumbnails, room lighting check etc. So a design ID goes in as input, comes out realistic design images.
- Both these plugins worked and supported designs that created in both Spacejoy's Unity app and blender.
- Company also had a 3D catalogue of 70 thousand furnitures, and their thumbnails were generated using my plugin.

Some outputs from the backend plugin:
