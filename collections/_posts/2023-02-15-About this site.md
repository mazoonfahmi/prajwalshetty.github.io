Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Prajwal Shetty, and I'm a game developer with 5 years of experience in the industry. I specialize in game programming and 3D math, with expertise in Unity, Unreal Engine 5, and Blender Python API.

I have a particular interest in open-world games and virtual worlds, and I love creating immersive experiences that transport players to new and exciting places. In my spare time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in technology and exploring new programming concepts.

On this blog, I share my thoughts and insights on game development, programming, and tech. Whether you're a fellow game developer, a tech enthusiast, or just someone looking for a good read, I hope you'll find something of interest here.

As well as my professional interests, I also have a passion for travel and exploring new places. You may find the occasional post about my adventures, and how they inspire my work.

I love to write and believe that blogging is an excellent way to express my thoughts and ideas. I hope you'll find my writing engaging, informative, and thought-provoking. Thanks for stopping by!
